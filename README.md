This repository contains code associated with Harrison Mouat's M4R project for Imperial College London.

The code consists of `zdt_simulator/trader.py`, which contains a `Trader` class which interacts with the `Exchange` class in `zdt_simulator/exchange.py` to simulate the iterated market game described in the project.
